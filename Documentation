Pipeline:
1. Class Imbalance Handling:  
   At each stage, the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was performed on the GSE183635 dataset to handle class imbalance.  

2. Dataset Splitting:  
   Samples were randomly divided into an 80% training set and a 20% testing set.  

3. Feature Preprocessing:  
   VarianceThreshold was applied to remove features with low variance.  

4. Preliminary Feature Selection:  
   - Minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) feature selection was used to select the top 1000 features from the initial 5434 features.

5. Wrapper Feature Selection:  
   - SelectFromModel was used with RF (Random Forest) and SVM (Support Vector Machine) to further filter the 1000-selected features by mRMR, with `max_features` set to 250.  
   - Overlapping features selected between RF and SVM were extracted.  

6. Feature Refinement:  
   - RFE-SVM (Recursive Feature Elimination with SVM) and SFS-SVM (Sequential Feature Selection with SVM) were performed on the overlapping features.  
     - For SFS, default parameters were used, which select half of the input features.  
     - For RFE, training and testing accuracy was compared against the number of selected features, and the number of features at which testing accuracy reached the maximum was selected.  

7. Final Model Development:  
   - Overlapping features between RFE and SFS were used to train and test the final model using Random Forest (RF).  

8. External Validation:  
   - The final model was externally tested on the external dataset GSE158508.  

Models:
   - Random Forest.
   - SVM.
