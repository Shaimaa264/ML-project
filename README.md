# Tumor-Educated Platelets-Based Ovarian Cancer Staging Through Feature Selection Techniques and Supervised Machine Learning Models
## Project Overview
The proposed research focuses on exploiting feature selection techniques and supervised machine learning models for identifying blood-based stage-specific biomarkers in platelets that discriminate healthy controls from OC patients with different stages.  

## Installation 
- Install required dependencies in requirements.txt.

## Setup and Usage
- For python scripts, just run the code cells. 
- For R scripts, set your working directory, unzip external_validation_raw_counts.zip to your desired working directory which will give ImPlatelet_counts_raw.tsv. Load genes.csv file and ImPlatelet_counts_raw.tsv in your working directory and run the rest of code.

## Additional information 
For extra guidance, check documentations of requirements.txt file
