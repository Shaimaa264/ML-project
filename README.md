# Tumor-Educated Platelets-Based Ovarian Cancer Staging Through Feature Selection Techniques and Supervised Machine Learning Models
## Project Overview
The proposed research focuses on exploiting feature selection techniques and supervised machine learning models for identifying blood-based stage-specific biomarkers in platelets that discriminate healthy controls from Ovarian cancer patients with different stages. Genes selected by multiple feature selection techniques will be further investigated for their prognostic value through survival analysis.  

## Installation 
- Install required dependencies in requirements.txt.

## Setup and Usage
- For python scripts, just run the code cells. 
- For R scripts, set your working directory, unzip external_validation_raw_counts.zip to your desired working directory which will give ImPlatelet_counts_raw.tsv. Load genes.csv file and ImPlatelet_counts_raw.tsv in your working directory and run the rest of code.

## Additional information 
For extra guidance, check documentations of requirements.txt file

## Output 
In additional files, Final identified features are attached as csv files and survival associated features are attached as excel file.
