# Tumor-Educated Platelets-Based Ovarian Cancer Staging Through Feature Selection Techniques and Supervised Machine Learning Models
## Project Overview
The proposed research focuses on exploiting feature selection techniques and supervised machine learning models for identifying blood-based stage-specific biomarkers in platelets that discriminate healthy controls from OC patients with different stages.
